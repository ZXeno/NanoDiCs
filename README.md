# NanoDiCs
Nano Dependency Injection for C# (.Net 4.7.2), my personal Dependency Injection library I developed while learning about DI and use in most of my personal projects. This code has been around in one form or another for the last 6 years.

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/qv58fqv2x2vmbvt6?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ZXeno/nanodics)

### Objective
The objective of this project was two-fold: to learn how DI worked and to use it on a regular basis. This library is used in nearly every personal project I initiate, whether it is here on github or not. This repo is an abstraction of that code into a buildable library and to keep that code available for others if they decide they want to use or contribute to it.

### Reinstated!
This project was previously deprecated, but has found new lease in a couple of recent recent projects and tools. I've updated the project files to compile against .Net Standard 2.1 and still retain the .Net Framework 4.7.2+ compatibility. As of the update of this readme, .Net Standard 2.1 compatibility is available.
