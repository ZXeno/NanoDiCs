# NanoDiCs
Nano Dependency Injection for C#, my personal Dependency Injection library I developed while learning about DI and use in most of my personal projects. This code has been around in one form or another for the last 5 years, but I am now moving it to github.

### Objective
The objective of this project was two-fold: to learn how DI worked and to use it on a regular basis. This library is used in nearly every project I initiate, whether it is here on github or not. This repo is an abstraction of that code into a buildable library and to keep that code available for others if they decide they want to use or contribute to it.
